			Quantum technology is an emerging field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics 
			to develop innovative technologies with capabilities beyond the reach of classical technologies. 
			<!-- It encompasses various disciplines, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, quantum sensors, and quantum communication.		 -->
		</p>
	
		<p>Quantum technology harnesses the unique properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, to develop advanced technologies with various practical applications.</p>
			<ul>	
				<li><b>Superposition:</b> Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in a superposition of states, enabling them to represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform computations in parallel, potentially solving certain problems much faster than classical computers.</li>

				<li><b>Entanglement:</b> Entangled particles share a strong correlation regardless of the distance between them. Changes to one particle instantly affect the other, providing a basis for secure communication (quantum cryptography) and potentially enhancing computational power in quantum systems.</li>

				<li><b>Quantum Interference:</b> Quantum systems can exhibit interference patterns, allowing for precise measurements and sensing. Quantum sensors leverage this property for highly accurate measurements of magnetic fields, gravitational waves, and more.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Here are the key aspects of the application of quantum technology, some of which will be discussed in this course:</p>
	
		<ol>
			<li> Quantum Computing;</li>
			<li> Quantum Cryptography and Secure Communication;</li>
			<li> Quantum Sensing and Metrology;</li>
			<li> Quantum Communication; </li>
			<li> Quantum Materials and Quantum Simulation.</li>	
		</ol>

		<p>
			At present, quantum technologies are still in their early phases of development and faces challenges in maintaining qubit coherence, error correction, scalability, building practical quantum devices etc. 
			Significant progress in quantum technology stands poised to revolutionize industries and scientific exploration, offering solutions to challenges that classical technology struggles to address. 
			Ongoing research endeavors aim to leverage unique quantum phenomena, envisioning the creation of influential and innovative technologies for tomorrow.
